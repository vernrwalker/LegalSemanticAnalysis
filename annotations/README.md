# Annotations

The process of annotating a document (also called "labeling" or "tagging" the text) is a classification task, in which we classify spans of text using categories. We can store such information in a variety of forms, such as XML or JSON files. What is important here is that such annotation captures semantic information about the legal meaning and significance of that text.
