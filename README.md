My ultimate goal as a lawyer and law professor is to extract **reasoning patterns** from **legal documents**, in order to use them to formulate better **arguments** in future cases.

A document begins as plain text. We add to this **semantic** markup or annotation, which adds a layer of meaning to the selected span of text.

In the case of legal documents, the meaning that lawyers understand is legal in nature. Words and phrases may have different meanings than their non-legal look-alikes, and statements might have distinctive implications depending upon the legal context. Moreover, words, phrases, sentences, and sets of sentences may have different significance, depending upon the legal context. We can capture these many layers of meaning through "**legal semantic analysis**."
