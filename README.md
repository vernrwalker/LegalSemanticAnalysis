My ultimate goal as a lawyer and law professor is to extract **reasoning patterns** from **legal documents**, in order to use them to formulate better **arguments** in future cases.

A document begins as plain text. We add to this **semantic** markup or annotation, which adds layers of meaning to specific spans of text.

With respect to legal documents, the meaning that lawyers understand is legal in nature. Words and phrases may have different meanings than their non-legal uses, and statements made with sentences or clauses might have distinctive implications in law. Moreover, the same words, phrases, clauses, sentences, and sets of sentences may have varying significance, depending upon the legal context. We can capture these many layers of meaning through "**legal semantic analysis**."
