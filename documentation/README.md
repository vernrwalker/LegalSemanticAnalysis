# Documentation

Documentation takes at least three forms:

1. **Protocols** for defining semantic categories, providing examples, and otherwise explaining the semantic information captured in [annotations](https://vernrwalker.github.io/LegalSemanticAnalysis/annotations/). Such protocols are important for various tasks, including:
    - training new annotation specialists;
    - evaluating the work product of annotators (whether human or machine); and
    - providing insights into features for writing scripts or training models within [analytics](https://vernrwalker.github.io/LegalSemanticAnalysis/analytics/).
2. **Settings** and **descriptions** for [analytics](https://vernrwalker.github.io/LegalSemanticAnalysis/analytics/) trained and evaluated.
3. **Publications** discussing the work and results in detail, so that others working on similar projects can follow the progress, make suggestions, and develop their own ideas in an efficient way.
